		<h1>Brick Smasher</h1>
		<p>
			Brick Smasher is a simple brick smashing game, but instead of balls bouncing off bricks, they fly right through them.
			Destroying them as they go.
		</p>
		<p>
			The player uses the left and right arrow keys to control the paddle and hit the ball towards the bricks. The object 
			of the game is to destroy all bricks before running out of lives.
		</p>
		<h2>Main Game</h2>

		<p>
			The paddle in the game uses different points on its hitbox as well as the ball's incoming angle to calculate a 
			natural angle to bounce off at. For example, if the ball is coming in at a steep vertical angle towards the corner of
			the paddle, it will bounce off at a steep horizontal angle.
		</p>
		<h2>Winning and Losing</h2>

			<img src="images/brick-smasher/lose-screen.png" height = "auto" width = "400">
		</div>
		<p>
			If the player hits all the bricks without losing all their lives, they will win and be asked if they want to play again.
			If they lose all their lives before destroying all the bricks, they will lose and will also be asked if they want to
			play again.
