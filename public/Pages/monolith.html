            Gravitron is a puzzle-platformer where the player controls Dr. Gravitron as he uses anti-gravity technology to navigate 
            Dr. Wretched's lab trying to save his beloved dog Atom. The central mechanic in the game is the ability to flip gravity. 
            By pressing the up arrow when on the ground, gravity will flip for Gravitron and he will be able to walk on the ceiling. 
            The extension of this mechanic is Gravitron's gun which fires a large, heavy projectile that has gravity that 
            is always opposite to Gravitron's. So if Gravitron is on the gorund and fires his gun, the projectile will fall towards 
            the ceiling. If Gravitron is on the ceiling and he shoots his gun, the projectile will fall to the floor. These 
            mechanics are utilized in tandem by the player to solve the games puzzle's.

            Each level in Gravitron consists of navigating a dangerous environmnet to find a button. When pressed, the button opens a door
            at the end of the level allowing the player to progress. Obstacles in the environment and placement of the button require
            the player to take advantage of Gravitron's gun and anit-gravity abilities in order to reach the goal. In the above images,
            the button Gravitron needs to press is on the ceiling and tucked away in a difficult to access gap so he must use his gun
            to press it if he wants to proceed.

        <p>
            In the above images, lethal orbs of light block the path towards the level's button. To proceed Gravitron must use his 
            gun to fire a projectile and block the oncoming onslaught of orbs.

        <h2>Animation and Art Design</h2>
        <img src="images/gravitron/running-game-version.gif" width = "501" height = "695"> 
        <p>
            I designed all of the assets (except for one cage sprite used in the final cutscene) used in the game and created 
            the animations. The animations were created using an IPad and Procreate. Each animation is hand-drawn and consists 
            of many frames which when played consecutively creates the illusion of movement of Gravitron's sprite
