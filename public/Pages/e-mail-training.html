		<h1>E-mail Training System</h1>
		<p>
			This e-mail training system was designed as part of a community based term project completed as a group with
			several classmates for Autism NS. It was designed with the intention of helping Austism NS's clients learn how 
			to use and get more familiar with e-mail systems.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is a server-based mock-up e-mail system which allows a user to send e-mails to an admin who can then respond.
			The interface is designed to replicate that of real e-mail systems and allows the user to navigate through
			several pages including a settings page, a page for viewing an e-mail, a page for e-mail composition, a page for their
			inbox, a page for their sentbox and a login page. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My main role in the project was designing the main user interface. I styled the majority of the main pages, trying
			to replicate the look and feel of Microsoft Outlook. Though my main role was working on the interface, I also 
			contributed to the Javascript which interfaced with MongoDB.
		</p>
		<h2>Inbox</h2>

		<p> 
			The inbox page was the first page that I designed. Unread emails are highlighted in blue and read emails are 
			displayed in grey. The star icon is an option to favorite e-mails, which turns yellow when it is selected.
			The trash can is an option to delete e-mails. The "Other Folders" option in the side bar is a dropdown menu.
		</p>
		<h2>Composition Page</h2>
		<img src="images/e-mail-training/composition-page.png" height = "825" width = "1003">
		<p>
			The composition page was difficult to design as I was tasked with making it easy to understand for those who were
			unfamiliar with e-mail systems, but also required to make it look as much like a real e-mail system as possible. When
			the user hovers over the To, Cc, Bcc, Subject and Body headers pop-ups will display explaining to the user what should
			be included in each of those boxes.  
		</p>
		<h2>Settings Page</h2>
		<img src="images/e-mail-training/settings.png" height = "571" width = "1001">
		<p>
			The settings page allows the user to change settings which correspond to levels of familiarity with e-mail systems.
			The user can choose to disable settings once they are familiar enough with the interface to no longer need as much
			guidance. The user can also select different colour themes for the system from this page.
