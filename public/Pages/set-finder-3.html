            The rules in SET are simple, but the game itself is difficult. From a deck of 81 cards, 12 are drawn and layed
            face up on a table. From this hand of cards, the players must try and find a 'set' of 3 cards that meets certain
            criteria. Each card has 4 attributes, a colour, a number, a shading and a shape, and each of those attributes has
            can take on 1 of 3 values. Colour: red, purple, green. Number: 1, 2, 3. Shading: hatched, empty, solid. Shape: 
            diamond, oval, squiggle. A 'set' is any three cards which for every one of the four attributes, the three cards either 
            have the same attribute values (e.g 3 cards are all green), or all different attribute values (e.g. each card has a different
            type of shape; one is diamond, one is oval, and one is squiggly). When a player spots a set, they call out "set"
            and then collect the three cards from the board that form the set. Three new cards are then dealt. This continues
            until the whole deck has been dealt. At the end, whoever has found more sets wins the game. More detailed instructions
            can be found <a href="https://www.setgame.com/sites/default/files/instructions/SET%20INSTRUCTIONS%20-%20ENGLISH.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

            SET is a challenging game to wrap your head around at first and when playing, there is no way to check if the cards you have been 
            dealt contain a set or not. I designed a piece of software that can interpret a set of cards and tell the players if 
            any sets exist in the hand. This helps to keep the game going when it would otherwise come to a standstill.
        </p>
        <p>
            My brother and I used to play this game a lot and we would always get frustrated when we got to a hand where we
            we did not know if there were any sets or not. That was my motivation for developing this software.
        </p>
        <p>
            My <a href="./set-finder-2.html" target="_blank">original iteration</a> of this project was a program with a command line 
            interface. Although this worked, it forced the user to use a key to identify the ID of each card that needed to be
            input. The results of the program were also unintuitive to read. For version 3.0, I upgraded the program from a 
            command-line interface implemented in C++, to a GUI interface using Unity 2019. The GUI is much more intuitive than the original
            program, as the visual nature of the game really lends itself to a visual oriented interface.
        </p>
        <h2>Upgraded Selection Interface</h2>
        <img src="images/set-finder-3/card-select.png" width = "691" height = "521">
        <p>
            The card selection screen now allows the user to click the cards in the hand to select them. Selected cards will be greyed 
            out to indicate that they have already been selected. The user is able to select 9, 12 or 15 cards and hit the "SET" button 
            to check for sets. The program allows the user to deselect and reselect cards in case they clicked the wrong card. It also
            displays the amount of cards currently selected in case the user loses track. The program will also stop the user from 
            running the program with the incorrect amount of cards or selecting more than the maximum 15 cards.
        </p>
        <h2>More Intuitive Set Display</h2>
        <img src="images/set-finder-3/view-sets.png" width = "699" height = "521">
        <p>
            If sets are found, the program will tell the user how many sets were found and display a "View" button. When the "View"
            button is pressed, the first set that was found will be highlighted in blue on the board. Hitting the "View" button
            again will display the next set. You can continue clicking until there are no more sets to display. Once sets have been
            found, an "Again" button also appears which when clicked resets the program and allows the user to input a new hand.
        </p>
        <h2>No Sets Found</h2>
        <img src="images/set-finder-3/no-sets.png" width = "697" height = "519">
        <p>
            If no sets are found, the program will alert the user, but it will continue to allow the user to input or change cards
            in the hand. When playing set, if you find a hand of 12 cards has no sets, you then put down 3 more cards and continue
            playing. In this case, if players still can't find a set in the hand, they can simply add the 3 new cards in the
            program and recheck for sets.
