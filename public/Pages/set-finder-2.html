			This program allows users to check if there are any sets in a hand of cards in the card game SET.
		</p>
        <p>
            This is an older version of the GUI version Set Finder 3.0. This version uses a command line interface and a key
            for translating cards to IDs which can then be fed into the program. 
        </p>
		<h2>Opening Screen</h2>

			In different circumstances, the amount of cards in a hand can vary from 9 to 15. 
			The software allows you to account for the three different possible board layouts: 9, 12 and 15 cards.
		</p>
		<h2>Card Input and ID Key</h2>

		<p>
			In order to find sets, the user must input the cards that are in the hand. To make this as easy
			as possible, I created a visual key with IDs for each card. The user will be prompted to enter each card
			in the hand's ID before the program will check for sets.
		</p>
		<h2>Checking For Sets</h2>

		</div>
		<p>
			As stated above, each card has four attributes. In the code of the program, each attribute value is given a number
			value of 1, 2 or 3. To check if three cards are a set, the program looks at each attribute and adds each cards
			value for that attribute together. If the resulting values for a single attribute is 3 or 9, that indicates all 
			the values on the cards for that attribute are the same, if the resulting value is a 6, the values are either all 
			the same or all different for that attribute. If all attributes meet these criteria, the cards are a set. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The program checks every possible combination of three cards in the user inputted hand for a set, and returns the
			three cards that make the set if there is one. If there is more than one set, the program will display all sets. 
			The program tells the user there is no set if no combination meets the above criteria.
