          Monolith is a top-down action adventure game developed in under a week
          for the Brackey's 2022 Game Jam. You play as the protagonist who is
          trying to destroy three monoliths which your friends are trapped in.
          After destroying the three monoliths you have to go head to head with
          the final boss to save the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game was designed by me and my friend Don using Unity/C# for
          programming and Aseprite for art. My main contributions to the project
          were art & concept design, asset creation and animation.
