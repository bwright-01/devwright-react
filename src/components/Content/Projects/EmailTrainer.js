        As part of a community driven project during my studies at Saint Mary's,
        I worked with fellow classmates to design an e-mail training system for
        a local community organization called Autism NS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system was developed to help their clients learn how to use and get
        comfortable with e-mail systems. The system is private and runs on a
        server where a client is able to send simulated e-mails back and forth
        with their advisor.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main contribution to the project was designing and implementing the
        user interface with CSS and HTML, but I also contributed to the
        Javascript implementation.
