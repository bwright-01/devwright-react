        Gravitron is a puzzle platformer centered around manipulating gravity in
        order to navigate the labratory of the evil Dr. Wretched. The titular
        character, Dr. Gravitron uses his anti-gravity tech to navigate the
        laboratory and save his beloved dog Atom.

        The game was designed by me and two classNamemates, Ayumu Saito and
        Theresa Clarke, as a term long project for a course on game development.
        It was developed using Unity. My main contributions to the project were
        concept design, asset creation and animation, as well as AI
        implementation.
